Junior Security Analyst (L1) >> Senior Security Analyst >> SOC Engineer >> SOC Manager >> Incident Responder

A blue team comprises cyber security and technology professionals whose aim is to protect an information system from impending cyber threats by performing and implementing defensive actions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
L1 Analysts: Junior members who triage alerts and pass complex cases to L2
L2 Analysts: Experienced members who investigate more advanced attacks
Engineers: Experts in configuring security tools like EDR or SIEM
Manager: A person who manages the whole SOC team

==> Shellcode: A piece of code usually used by malicious actors during exploits like buffer overflow attacks to inject commands into a vulnerable system, often leading to executing arbitrary commands or giving attackers control over a compromised machine. Shellcode is typically written in assembly language and delivered through various techniques, depending on the exploited vulnerability.

==> PowerShell: A powerful scripting language and command-line shell built into Windows for task automation and configuration management. It allows users to interact with system components and is widely used by administrators for legitimate purposes. However, attackers often use PowerShell as a post-exploitation tool because of its deep access to system resources and ability to run scripts directly in memory, avoiding disk-based detection mechanisms.

==> Windows Defender: A built-in security feature that detects and prevents malicious scripts, including PowerShell-based attacks, by scanning code at runtime. Common bypass methods for evading Defender include obfuscating scripts to disguise malicious content, making it harder for the software to recognise known patterns. Another technique is a reflective injection, where malicious code is loaded directly into memory, avoiding detection by signature-based defences. We will cover the latter one in this task.

==> Windows API: The Windows Application Programming Interface (API) allows programs to interact with the underlying operating system, giving them access to essential system-level functions such as memory management, file operations, and networking. It serves as a bridge between the application and the operating system, enabling efficient resource handling. The Windows API is crucial because many exploitation techniques and malware rely on it to manipulate processes, allocate memory, and execute shellcodes. Common Windows API functions frequently used by malicious actors include VirtualAlloc, CreateThread, WaitForSingleObject, which we will also use in this task for exploitation.

==> Accessing Windows API through PowerShell Reflection: Windows API via PowerShell Reflection is an advanced technique that enables dynamic interaction with the Windows API from PowerShell. Instead of relying on precompiled binaries, PowerShell Reflection allows attackers to call Windows API functions directly at runtime. This will enable them to manipulate low-level system processes, making it a primary tool for bypassing security mechanisms, interacting with the operating system, and executing code stealthily.

==> Reverse shell: A type of connection in which the target (the machine you're trying to hack) initiates a connection back to your attacking machine.
